# Philippine-Financial-Institution-Chatbot
This is a rule-based chatbot that can handle some basic queries about the dataset using natural language processing. 

The dataset named Financial Institution (FI) has been used for my Geographic Information System course at the Carnegie Mellon University. I used two separate datasets namely, (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' Statistics - Physical Network)[https://www.bsp.gov.ph/SitePages/Statistics/BSPhysicalNetwork.aspx] and (Philippines Latitude and Longitude Map)[https://www.mapsofworld.com/lat_long/philippines-lat-long.html]. Before merging the two datasets, I first cleaned the banking statistics to only show the total number of FIs considering the time constraint in finalizing the project. Then I merged both dataset into one using Python programming.

The original project can be accessed using the following ArcGIS Pro links:
**1. Storymap:** (Looking at the Philippines' Financial Inclusion)[https://arcg.is/XTXOa0]

**2. Dashboard:** (Financial Access for Filipinos with a High Poverty Incidence) [https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/197fe276e52b460dba14668e462f0342
